![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)

My own personal [awesome list](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/blob/main/awesome.md) in a variety of topics.

# Software Engineering

  * [A Few Thoughts About Path Coverage](https://blog.regehr.org/archives/386)
    * Some interesting thoughts on what it means for a code-base to really be thoroughly unit-tested.
    
  * [3 tribes of programming](https://josephg.com/blog/3-tribes/)
    * Incredibly elucidating analysis of the cultural divides within the software engineering community. Also, explains why I really like Rust. :)
    
  * [Sum Types are Not a Silver Bullet](https://sintrastes.github.io/blog/posts/2021-07-19-sum_types_are_not_a_silver_bullet.html)
    * This is something I wrote -- but I think it's an incredibly important lesson when trying to architect applications and systems in a functional style.
    
# PL Research Languages

  * [Koka](https://koka-lang.github.io/koka/doc/index.html)
    * Really innovative optimization (reuse analysis) that in many cases can convert functional style code to runtime-less C that mutates in place.

# Haskell

  * [Learn You a Haskell For Great Good](http://learnyouahaskell.com/)
    * Maybe somewhat outdated, but a very good and gentle introduction to the language. Also, it's free to read online, so you have no excuse!

# Kotlin

# Rust
